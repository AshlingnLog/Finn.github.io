<ol> What does a day with them look like?
    <li> Wake up, cuddle, brush teeth, get dressed and feed everyone breakfast.</li>
    <li> If it's the weekend and sunny we go to the farm to hang out with Grandma and all the animals.</li>
    <li> Give out snacks, make sure everyone is drinking water.</li>
    <li> Sometimes we also get to ride, collect eggs, pick pumpkins, apples, or berries. </li>
    <li> Next it's time to drive home and figure out lunch.</li>
    <li> Madi likes to do something creative in the afternoon, but sometimes we go to the playground or a bike ride.</li>
    <li> We have a short break before making Dinner, usually we get to cuddle. </li>
    <li> Next it's getting ready for bedtime. Bath and Brushing teeth, then jammies and a story.</li>
